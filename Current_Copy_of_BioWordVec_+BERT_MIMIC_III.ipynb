Per daughter, patient was in her\\nusual state of health until early [**Month (only) **] when she had back\\npain after making her bed. An x-ray of her back was taken and\\nshe was told she had a \\\"pinched nerve\\\" for which she was treated\\nwith one week of a prednisone taper and vicodin with good\\nimprovement.  Subsequently, on the week of [**2124-8-21**], she began\\nto complain of abdominal pain and general malaise. The following\\nweek, on [**2124-8-28**], she had a fever at home as well as rash on\\nher arms and legs, which was raised and painful to touch.  She\\nwas seen by her PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2124-8-30**]; CXR and blood tests\\nwere performed. Per her daughter, she was feeling extremely weak\\nand had poor po intake during these days. Based on the results\\nof the blood tests, she was referred to oncology. She was seen\\nby Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 56871**] on [**2124-9-1**] for her pancytopenia and admitted\\ndirectly to the hospital as she appeared tachypneic and unwell.\\n\\n\\nDuring her hospital admission, bone marrow biopsy was performed\\nthat showed 18% blasts concerning for high grade myelodysplastic\\nsyndrome as well as granulomas concerning for fungal infections.\\nHeme/onc was consulted who felt that initiating treatment for\\nmyelodysplasia was not warranted. ID was also consulted as she\\nhad persistent fevers to 102-103, ANC ranged 1000-1400. She was\\ntransferred to the ICU for hypotension with intermittent fluid\\nboluses to maintain BPs. ID was concerned for strep pharyngitis\\nand recommended ceftriaxone (discouraged vanc/cefepime as these\\ncould worsen pancytopenia).  Infectious work-up included TTE, CT\\nabdomen/pelvis, BCxs and stool studies that were unremarkable.\\nUrine was weakly positive for histoplasmosis. She was given a\\ndose of amphotericin that caused rigors and tachycardia. She was\\nthen placed on trial of IV solumedrol 80mg TID and fevers\\ndefervesced. On day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she had worsening\\nhypoxemia with increasing FiO2 requirement. CXR showed diffuse\\nbilateral pulmonary infiltrate, predominantely perihilar in\\ndistribution, and b/l pleural effusions. ID had recommended that\\nsteroids be discontinued on transfer and amphotericin resumed\\n(150mg daily). She was also given a dose of lasix for volume\\noverload prior to transfer.\\n\\nOn the floor, she reports that she is comfortable. She reports\\nthat her breathing has improved. She denies pain anywhere,\\nincluding abdominal pain. She reports her diarrhea has resolved\\nwith immodium. + dry mouth, but was able to tollerate po in the\\nICU.\\n\\nReview of Systems:\\n(+) Per HPI\\n(-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.

She was transferred\\nfrom OSH with worsening respiratory distress satting mid 90's on\\nNRB. CXR showed diffuse b/l pulmonary infiltrates and small\\npleural effusions. She was treated empirically for HCAP with\\nvancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. Also continued on\\nambisome per ID recs due to reports of positive histoplasmosis\\nantigen from OSH. She was diuresed with IV lasix approximately\\n4L prior to transfer to the floor. She was electively intubated\\nfor bronchoscopy on [**9-13**], and was successfull extubated the\\nfollowing day.  As below, the BAL returned bloody fluid.  On\\n[**9-18**], the again began to experience respiratory distress\\nassociated with borderline BP and a 10 point decrease in her\\nhematocrit.  She was again transferred to the ICU for further\\nmonitoring.  Her blood pressures remained fluid responsive to\\nboth IVF and PRBCs (1 unit).  It was felt that the etiology of\\nher hypoxia and hypotension was possible due to additional\\nalveolar hemorrhage.  Her respiratory status and blood pressures\\nimproved during her ICU stay and were stable prior to transfer\\nback to the general medical floor. On the floor, she continued\\nto do better. On one occasion on the night of [**9-22**], the patient\\nspiked a fever after 48 hours of afebrile condition. A chest\\nx-ray showed possible LUL pneumonia, which was treated\\nemperically with vanco/zosyn. On day of discharge, the patient's\\nrespiratory status was stable, requiring supplemental oxygen\\nafter exertion.\\n\\n# Fever: She had persistent fevers at OSH despite being on\\nceftriaxone and then amphotericin/itraconazole. Work up at OSH\\nincluded CT abdomen, CT chest, TTE, BCx, and stool studies which\\nwere been unremarkable. Urine was weakly positive for\\nhistoplasma antigen at OSH, and she was started on amphotericin.\\nUrine culture on admission grew 10-100K VSE and BAL returned\\nbloody fluid. Otherwise blood, urine, and BAL cultures were\\nunremarkable, including repeat urine culture. She continued to\\nspike fevers, and CT a/p showed no source of infection, although\\ndid mention fluid in the endometrial cavity. She was ruled out\\nx3 for TB. Histoplasma and autoimmune serologies are negative.\\nAfter transfer to the floor, patient was afebrile for 48 hours.\\nSpiked spontaneously on one evening, and initially the chest\\nx-ray was concerning for LUL pneumonia, and the patient was\\nstarted on vancomycin/zosyn for treatment of ventilator acquired\\nPNA. In the interim, the patinet's urine culture grew out VRE,\\nonly susceptible to linezolid. The patient was discharged on the\\nremainder of a 3 day course of levaquin and voriconazole which\\nshe was to continue until final results of the histo PCR were\\ncomplete.\\n\\n# Pancytopenia: Bone marrow biopsy from OSH reportedly showed\\n18% blasts with myelodysplasia concerning for new diagnosis of\\nAML. Also with reported granulomas.  Heme/onc was consulted who\\nreviewed outside smear, and recommended repeating smear with\\ncultures performed. Platelets continually dropped during stay in\\nMICU and patient received 1 unit of platelets. Patient also\\nreceived a unit of RBCs while on the floor and also while in the\\nunit (2 units total). Repeat bone marrow biopsy was consistent\\nwith MDS as opposed to AML. The patient's white blood cell count\\ncontinued to drop through the admission, and she did become\\nneutropenic; her neutropenia was attributed to her underlying\\nMDS. The patient will need follow-up on an outpatient basis for\\nmonitoring, transufions of blood products as well as for\\ntreatment of underlying MDS. Transfusions goals are 1 unit for a\\nhematocrit of less than 24 or platelets less than 30.\\n\\n# Rash: Initial presentation concerning for erythema nodosum.\\nPer OSH records, biopsy was sent to [**Last Name (un) **] Life Sciences for\\noutside consultation. Biopsy slides were arranged to be sent to\\nour pathology department. Pathology report also consistent with\\nerythema nodosum.\\n\\n# Diarrhea: She has chronic diarrhea, and arrived from OSH with\\nflexiseal in place. C. Diff and stool cutlures were negative.\\nShe was treated symptomatcially with loperamide with good\\neffect. During this hospitalization, C. diff antigen x 2 and PCR\\nwere all negative. Flexiseal was discontinued during the\\nadmission. Continue home loperamide as needed for diarrhea upon\\ndischarge from the hospital.\\n\\n# Left UE DVT: Left arm noted to be swollen during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.\\nUENI showed clot in left arm associated with PICC line. Line was\\npulled, and there was resolution of the erythema associated with\\nthe left upper extremity DVT. The patient was not started on\\nanticoagulation given her thrombocytopenia.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\\n1. Continue on Voriconazole as ordered until we receive final\\nresults of the histoplasmosis PCR, which we expect will be by\\nWednesday, [**9-27**]. If the results are negative we will\\nstop the voriconazole. If the results are positive we will\\ncontinue the voriconazole and schedule her for a follow up\\nappointment with the infectious disease clinic at [**Hospital1 **].\\n2. Continue the levofloxacin for one more day, to end on\\nWednesday, [**9-27**].\\n3.

You presented to us with shortness of\\nbreath and fevers. While with us, we determined that you likely\\nsuffered the fevers from an infection infection. Your shortness\\nof breath was attributed to bleeding in your lungs, which\\nstopped during your hospital [**Last Name (un) 10128**].  We also determined that you\\nlikely have myelodysplastic syndrome, which will require further\\nworkup and treatment as an outpatient.\\n\\nThe following changes were made to your medication:\\nADDED:\\n- Combivent inhaler 1-2 puffs as needed for shortness of\\nbreath/wheezing every 4 to 6 hours\\n- Levaquin which you should take for 3 days\\n- Voriconazole, which you should continue until we have final\\nresults of your test for histoplasmosis. We expect to have these\\nresults within the next week.\\n\\nYou had a skin biopsy while you were here. You need to have your\\nsutures removed two weeks after the biopsy which was [**9-18**], so\\nthe sutures should be removed on or around [**10-1**]. One of your\\nphysicians at the facility you are going to can remove them.\\nUntil then the dressing on the wound from your biopsy should be\\nchanged daily and the wound treated with vaseline.\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\nDepartment: HEMATOLOGY/BMT\\nWhen: TUESDAY [**2124-10-3**] at 3:00 PM\\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 3750**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3885**], NP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3886**]\\nBuilding: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **]\\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\\n\\nDepartment: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY\\nWhen: TUESDAY [**2124-10-3**] at 3:00 PM\\nWith: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3884**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3237**]\\nBuilding: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **]\\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\\n\\n\\n                             [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD, [**MD Number(3) 1368**]\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ICD9_CODE\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
